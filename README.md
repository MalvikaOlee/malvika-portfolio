### Project Summary
This cloud project focuses on designing a Data Analytics Platform (DAP) for the City of Vancouver, centered around three municipal datasets: Cooling Tower Water, Decorative Water Features, and Building Water Treatment Systems. The project implements a complete AWS pipeline — starting from ingestion and profiling to transformation, governance, and monitoring.
